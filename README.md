# C-Like Compiler Project(SOC 2025)

- This is my project for the Seasons Of Code 2025.
- A toy compiler for a C-like programming language built entirely using c++
- The compiler supports Variable, Function declarations and initialisation. The compiler currently only supports int datatype.
- Scope tracking is supported along with features like if-else statements and while loops.
- At the current stage the implementation includes a lexer that can create tokens from the input code
- A parser that generates a Parse Syntax tree and prints it to the console and checks for syntax errors
- A semantic analyser that analyses The parsed code and looks for logical errors.

## What i have learned so far?

- **Tokenisation**: 1) How to break input source code into tokens (identifiers, numbers, keywords, symbols)
                    2) Handling whitespace and new line charachters efficiently.
                    3)
